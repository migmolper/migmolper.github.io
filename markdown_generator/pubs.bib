abstract = {Material Point Method (MPM) has arisen in the recent years as an alternative to Finite Element Method (FEM) under large deformations. However, the simulation of shock waves propagation in the large deformation regime is still challenging under this approach due to the incapability of the standard MPM time integration scheme to filter spurious noises. To overcome it, we propose in this paper an explicit Predictor‚ÄìCorrector time integration scheme. Its powerful performance mitigates the presence of spurious oscillations with minimal dissipation in high frequency problems. Other source of numerical noise in MPM occurs when the material points cross computational grid boundaries, being caused by the lack of smoothness of the interpolation functions. This noise results in spurious local variations at the material points, where strain‚Äìstress fields are computed. This could lead to inaccurate solutions as well as aborted simulations in the worst cases. To surmount it, we propose in this work the Local Maximum-Entropy (LME) approximation schemes as a robust substitute of the traditional shape function in MPM. The performance of both improvements is validated by the high quality results of the numerical examples.},

abstract = {The material point method can be regarded as a meshfree extension of the finite element method. This fact has two interesting consequences. On the one hand, this puts a vast literature at our disposal. On the other hand, many of this inheritance has been adopted without questioning it. A clear example of it is the use of the Voigt algebra, which introduces an artificial break point between the formulation of the continuum problem and its discretized counterpart. In the authors' opinion, the use of the Voigt rules leads to a cumbersome formulation where the physical sense of the operations is obscured since the well-known algebra rules are lost. And with them, the intuition about how stresses and strains are related. To illustrate it, we will describe gently and meticulously the whole process to solve the nonlinear governing equations for isothermal finite strain elastodynamics, concluding with a compact set of expressions ready to be implemented effortless. In addition, the classic Newmark-ùõΩ algorithm has been accommodated to the local maximum-entropy material point method framework by means of an incremental formulation.},

abstract = {Standard finite element formulation and implementation in solid dynamics at large strains usually relies upon and indicial-tensor Voigt notation to factorized the weighting functions and take advantage of the symmetric structure of the algebraic objects involved. In the present work, a novel component-free approach, where no reference to a basis, axes or components is made, implied or required, is adopted for the finite element formulation. Under this approach, the factorisation of the weighting function and also of the increment of the displacement field, can be performed by means of component-free operations avoiding both the use of any index notation and the subsequent reorganisation in matrix Voigt form. This new approach leads to a straightforward implementation of the formulation where only vectors and second order tensors in ‚Ñù3 are required. The proposed formulation is as accurate as the standard Voigt based finite element method however is more efficient, concise, transparent and easy to implement.},

	abstract = {Debris flows are a type of fast landslides where a mixture of soil and water propagates along narrow channels. The main characteristics are (1) important relative displacements between the solid and fluid phases, and (2) development of pore-water pressures in excess to hydrostatic. The ratios between vertical and horizontal displacements of the flow, from the triggering point to the deposition, indicate that friction angles are much smaller than those measured in laboratories. Debris flows are modeled as two phases flow, but implementing pore-water pressure is an important issue. The purpose of this paper is to improve the existing two phases debris flow models by implementing pore-water pressures in excess to hydrostatic. It is found that pore pressure evolution depends on consolidation, changes in the flow depth, and changes and gradients of porosity. The proposed depth integrated mathematical model is discretized using two sets of SPH nodes (solid and fluid), with a set of finite difference meshes associated with each solid material SPH point. The paper presents two examples from where it is possible to gain insight into the differences between the models (with and without excess pore water pressure).},

abstract = {In this publication the finite strain formulation is enhanced with a Generalized Plasticity model for sands. The new model is numerically solved using an Optimal Transportation Meshfree approach that is best suited for numerical analysis at finite strains. This new model allows to capture the hydro-mechanical response under large deformations of a saturated sand like soils where acceleration of water with respect the solid skeleton is not negligible. To the authors‚Äô knowledge, no attempt has been previously devoted to include in the finite strain approach an elastoplastic behavior from the Generalized Plasticity theory. In order to assess the validity of the proposed model, four standard laboratory tests are numerically reproduced: i) an undrained triaxial test under monotonic loading, ii) a triaxial consolidation test under monotonic loading with drained boundary conditions, iii) an undrained cyclic triaxial test and iv) a drained cyclic triaxial test. The observed results are qualitatively correct and in agreement with numerical solutions previously obtained by other researchers and with related experimental data.},

abstract = {Abstract Entrainment of saturated bed material increases the mobility of fast landslides. The distribution of excess pore pressures changes in the body of the landslide, as the material entering it has much lower effective confining stresses which results on much smaller apparent basal friction angles. The purpose of this paper is to enhance the Finite Differences depth integrated SPH model developed by the authors to cope with material which is flowing up the FD meshes. The model is set within an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian framework (ALE), and the resulting excess pore pressure evolution model will include now advective terms in addition to the diffusive and source terms. In order to assess the importance of the proposed modification, we introduce a basal P√©clet number which relates two non dimensional reference times of consolidation and¬†erosion.},

abstract = {In this paper, the theoretical framework is a depth-integrated two-phase model capable of considering many essential physical aspects such as reproducing the propagation of debris flows with soil permeability ranging from high to low and considering the pore-water pressure evolution. In this model, the pore fluid is described by an additional set of depth-integrated balance equations in order to take into account the velocity of pore fluid. The model employs a frictional rheological law for the granular material, and the interstitial fluid is treated as a Newtonian fluid. A drag law describes the interaction between interstitial fluid and grains. The variables of permeability, porosity, and drag force are included in the governing equations to consider the interaction between the phases. This paper aims to extend a generalized two-phase depth-integrated model to enhance the description of the interaction between the two phases and their respective movements. It allows us to increase our understanding of the mechanism behind natural rapid landslides. To evaluate the developed approach, a set of dam-break problems has been performed. These simulations provide interesting information in simple and controlled situations on the landslide propagations with different degrees of soil permeability and the interaction between solid and fluid phases. The extended model has also been applied to simulate the dynamics of the Acheron rock avalanche, which is an appropriate benchmark to examine the applicability of the model to real cases.}
