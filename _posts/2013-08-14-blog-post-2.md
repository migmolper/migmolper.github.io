Summary
======

In 2021 he was granted by the UPM to do a 5-month research stay at the University of
California Berkeley (UCB) where he joined the research group of Professor Kenichi Soga ([SRG](https://geomechanics.berkeley.edu/)).
As a visiting scholar at UCB, he investigated two main topics:

1. The implementation of finite strain formulations in elastoplasticity in the framework of the LME-MPM method.
2. The development of a Lagrangian formulation for fluid mechanics problems.

During the stage in UCB, he contributed to enhancing their local code ([CB-Geo](https://github.com/geomechanics/mpm), HPC C++) with the
implementation of the Local maximum-entropy shape functions. It Is worth mentioning that
he currently continues his collaboration with the SRG group in Berkeley via periodic meetings.
