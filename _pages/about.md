Research Interest
======
Miguel Molinos is a recent Ph.D. graduate in Computational Mechanics. His main line of
research during his PhD was the mathematical and numerical modelling of the inelastic behaviour of structures,
geostructures, and engineering materials (soils, concrete, steel, and rubber-like substances)
using mesh-free techniques. Right now he is working on the development of multiscale methods.

Short Biography
======
He received his (4 years) B.Eng. degree in Civil Engineering from the Universidad de Sevilla,
awarding an honours grade for his bachelor’s thesis in tsunami simulation. As an
undergraduate student he did a part-time internship in Drops and Bubbles Technology, a spin-
off of the Department of Aerospace Engineering and Fluid Mechanics of the University of
Seville where he worked in the simulation of bi-phasic flows with the commercial
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software ANSYS-Fluent. In September 2016 he moved to
Madrid to continue his studies in the School of Civil Engineering of the Universidad Politécnica
de Madrid (UPM).

In 2018 he obtained his (2 years) M.Eng. degree in Civil Engineering finishing in the first decile
of his promotion. Simultaneously, during a part-time internship in the Centre for Hydrographic
Studies (CEDEX, Spanish Public Administration), he contributed to the implementation of a
multi-thread GPU solver for Iber2D (CFD software). This internship provided him with
CV date 28/01/2022 important experience on practical engineering problems in a Technical Laboratory which is a
reference centre of Spain in its domain. This practical experience complements well his solid
theoretical background.

In September 2018 started his predoctoral research career in the Computational Mechanic
field in the Applied Mathematics Department of the Civil Engineering School of the UMP with
the [M2i group](https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Manuel-Pastor-Lab-2) led by Professor Manuel Pastor. After the first period of training where he took
courses to improve his programming skills (Introduction to R, Python for Engineers, and
Programming in the GPU with CUDA), he started the implementation from scratch of an open-
source code for mesh-free simulations ([NL-PartSol](https://github.com/migmolper/NL-PartSol), C). His research has been focused on the
proposal, development and assessment of the Local maximum-entropy Material Point
Method (LME-MPM) for dynamic, fracture mechanics, finite strains, and poromechanics
problems. His contributions to the M2i group have been relevant. Indeed, he has overseen
opening a new research line, modelling materials with complex behaviour using the LME-MPM
method, instead of the classical SPH approach used so far. His research was financed between
2018 and 2020 by the Agustín de Betancourt foundation and in 2021 by the José Entrecanales
Ibarra foundation.

In December of 2021, he defended his thesis entitled ["The Local Maximum-EntropyMaterial Point Method"](https://oa.upm.es/69327/) obtaining the qualification of cum laude and the recognition of
international doctor. Apart from investigating the research line derived from his thesis, he is
an active collaborator of the existing research line in the M2i group. From the published
papers, it can be seen this interaction, as he has contributed to developing SPH models for soil
dynamics problems domain in which he has acquired the long and solid experience of the
group, together with papers led by him, where is the group who has benefitted. He is an active
member of the competitive projects, ALAS (Plan Estatal 2016) and PLAND (Plan Estatal 2019). Indeed, he has contributed to the
elaboration of research proposals, being worth mentioning the last Plan Nacional project,
PLAND, which explicitly includes the novel MPM approach, line of which he is responsible.
Regarding formation activities, he has contributed to the ellaboration of a Massive open
online course (MOOC) entitled “Principales riesgos naturales y su afección a la Sociedad”.

Indeed, the experience of the candidate in advanced calculation schemes (particle and
meshfree methods) and the suitability of such methodologies within the project, make
complementary the skills of the receiving group and the researcher.
